# UFOs

## Project Overview
This project displays UFO sighting data and allows users to filter for multiple criteria: date, city, state, country, and shape. The JavaScript codes reads the data file, displays results in a table, and provides user inputs for filtering.

## Results

## Summary 
- one drawback of the new design
the search criteria must be exact matches to the data set. Ex. state: "SC" vs. "sc". 

- Reccomendations for further development
Consider adding drop-down menu filters than free text to reduce user input / mismatches. Dynamic filters could be really cool if the user first filtered by state and then dynamically revealing the city options for that state, rather than having to guess. Reducing user input errors or data type mismatches 
- case sensitivity, extra spaces not exact matches
- date add in a calendar view rather than entering numbers (Example)
